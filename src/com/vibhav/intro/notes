// in java there is no pass by reference. Only Pass by value.
Thats why swap function doesnot work in java . bcz it only passes value of variables not there reference.


Static variable -

wrong-
while accessing , declaring or modifieng static variable never do by a reference variable. It will work but never do
eg - System.out.println(Vibhav.population);

correct-
It must be used using class name
eg - System.out.println(Human.population);

*Important
Main function is static. Which means we can use main method without creating object of that class.
