// in java there is no pass by reference. Only Pass by value.
Thats why swap function doesnot work in java . bcz it only passes value of variables not there reference.


Static variable -

wrong-
while accessing , declaring or modifieng static variable never do by a reference variable. It will work but never do
eg - System.out.println(Vibhav.population);

correct-
It must be used using class name
eg - System.out.println(Human.population);


*Important
From static we cannot use non static stuffffffff.



Main function is static. Which means we can use main method without creating object of that class.

Static method can only access static data.

Because somthing which is not static belonge to object.


Non static fun are dependent on objects.


non static fun can be called from another non static fun.

this doesnot work in static fun.
